This made communication a lot easier for us during the trip, since none of the people we met in the mountains spoke much english.

From here, we would traverse some 60 km of this impressive and exhaustingly steep range. Even with light packs we managed only on average 15 km a day. Only when you stand on the top ridge of this mountain range do you realize what you have committed to. A lot of scrambling (and sometimes climbing) on very exposed granite ridges with huge drops to the green valleys below. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/img_6636.jpg\" alt=\"null\"></p>\n<p>From here, you can see the vast, flat plateau from which the Carpathians rise so dramatically steep. You have the unspoiled view to great valleys filled with old, dense forest, dramatic gorges cut into the rock by roaring torrents and even snow caped mountains. The trail was easy to find and well marked, luckily, because we had some days with very foggy weather. In Romania, even way above the tree-line, there is a very rich community of flowers and other plants. This makes for the most beautiful and contrast-filled scenery.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/img_6507.jpg\" alt=\"null\"></p>\n<p>We even got lucky enough to see a herd of 15-17 wild black goats one day. We got a very clear understanding that this place (although people live up here for sheep herding) is a true wilderness, and a big one! We could have easily spend another week or two exploring the hidden treasures of these mountains, which seemed to be around every corner. Romania is definitely worthy of more trips in the future! I think there are challenges to be found here for even the most experienced wilderness-traveler and amazing opportunities for some very cool rock climbing as well. The Romanian wilderness will make you feel small and insignificant compared nature's forces. For me, this is exactly was wilderness travel is about and the Carpathians will leave you with amazing experiences equal to those you get in any of the more \"famous\" wildernesses around the world. The Carpathians are one of the more adventurous hiking destinations I have found within Europe!</p>\n<p>- Andreas JÃ¸rgensen</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/img_6550-1-.jpg\" alt=\"null\"></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 12, 2018","title":"The Transylvanian Adventure of two danish brothers","description":" ","tags":["\"When I travel","I always pick my destinations from a nature lovers point of view.
