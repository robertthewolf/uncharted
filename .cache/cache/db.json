The new descriptions are more detailed and hence allow cuppers to distinguish between more flavors.</p>\n<p>While this is going to be a big change for professional coffee tasters, it means a lot to you as a consumer as well. We’ll explain how the wheel came to be, how pros use it and what the flavors actually mean.</p>\n<h2>What the updates mean to you</h2>\n<p>The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA), founded in 1982, is a non-profit trade organization for the specialty coffee industry. With members located in more than 40 countries, SCAA represents every segment of the specialty coffee industry, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>producers</li>\n<li>roasters</li>\n<li>importers/exporters</li>\n<li>retailers</li>\n<li>manufacturers</li>\n<li>baristas</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For over 30 years, SCAA has been dedicated to creating a vibrant specialty coffee community by recognizing, developing and promoting specialty coffee. SCAA sets and maintains quality standards for the industry, conducts market research, and provides education, training, resources, and business services for its members.</p>\n<p>Coffee cupping, or coffee tasting, is the practice of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffee. It is a professional practice but can be done informally by anyone or by professionals known as \"Q Graders\". A standard coffee cupping procedure involves deeply sniffing the coffee, then loudly slurping the coffee so it spreads to the back of the tongue.</p>\n<p>The coffee taster attempts to measure aspects of the coffee's taste, specifically the body (the texture or mouthfeel, such as oiliness), sweetness, acidity (a sharp and tangy feeling, like when biting into an orange), flavour (the characters in the cup), and aftertaste. Since coffee beans embody telltale flavours from the region where they were grown, cuppers may attempt to identify the coffee's origin.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-647c2711bf72c748e691282da592d65f--","value":""},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-68d19455d7370a243dd26bbf0647b3ec--","value":""},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-a3c6ddc76d0b930ff321a9498fe56d70--","value":"<h2>Why we love this adventure?</h2>\n<p>• Your adventure is going to be <strong>unique</strong>.

You only need to skip Monday and on Tuesday morning you are back. And let’s be honest, wouldn’t you spend your Monday on an adventure rather than anywhere else?</p>\n<p>• It combines <strong>mountain activities, culture, gastronomy and interactive quests</strong> around the city, all in a 3-day adventure.</p>\n<p>• High emphasis on <strong>sustainable travelling</strong></p>\n<h2>Is this adventure suitable for you?</h2>\n<p>• A <strong>minimum level of fitness</strong> is required as the snowshoe hiking tour involves a fair amount of walking, allowing you to really get among nature;</p>\n<p>• Temperatures in the winter can get to ca. -15°C, so make sure you have proper winter clothes;</p>\n<p>• Even though the tour is suitable for families, some of the activities are <strong>not recommended</strong> for children bellow 14;</p>\n<p>• The tour focuses on <strong>more than just one activity</strong>, therefore the time is divided in such way that all activities can be performed.</p>\n<h2>Daily schedule</h2>\n<h3>Day 1</h3>\n<p><strong>Welcome</strong> to the mysterious Transylvania. Kick off your adventure with your group leader, who is going to wait for you at the starting point of the tour, Cluj Napoca Airport. From there we will head towards the 2007 Capital of Culture, the city of Sibiu. Our first activity will be a <strong>treasure hunt</strong> quest around the old city. The quest has been designed in such way that it will get you through the history of the city and help you discover the story of Sibiu’s 7 towers that influenced the growth of the city. You will have to follow the given clues, and whenever you feel that you are in a struggle, our team will be ready to give you extra hints in order for you to solve the clues and continue your discovery. The day will end with a <strong>gastronomical delight</strong> in terms of traditional food and placement at the Nobleman’s Pantry (Camara Boierului). The restaurant is the embodiment of tradition, culture and folk, starting from the interior designed and all the way to the food served.</p>\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\n<p>The old cities host the culture and traditions of Transylvania, but this is just one side of it. The breath-taking beauty relies in the nature that surrounds the land. That is why on the second day we will embark on an <strong>off-road 4x4 experience</strong>. We will take the snow-covered trails that will lead us to through the forest covered by the beauty of winter, all the way up on the mountains. Along the way, we will stop by different spots with breath-taking views in order for you, the traveller, to enjoy the beauty of the nature and take amazing photos for your portfolio, Instagram, Facebook or simply for the memory of the place. If the weather is not too harsh on us, we will stop for a cosy picnic or a BBQ, consisting of traditional bio products.

We recommend that you contact your insurance broker and ask for the suitable insurance for the chosen tour.<br>\nTravel insurance is compulsory for all our trips. We require that, at a minimum, you are covered for medical expenses including emergency repatriation. We strongly recommend that the policy also covers personal liability, curtailment and loss of luggage and personal effects.<br>\nIt is the adventurer’s own responsibility to ensure they purchase a travel insurance. Uncharted IVS is not to be held liable in case of any accidents that could have been covered by the travel insurance.</p>\n<h4>Medical and health information</h4>\n<p>All Uncharted adventurers need to be in a good physical health in order to fully participate on any of the activities. Please make sure you have read through the itinerary carefully when selecting your adventure and assess your ability to cope with our style of travel. Please note that if, in the opinion of our group leader or local guide, any adventurer is unable to complete the itinerary without undue risk to themselves and/or the rest of the group, Uncharted IVS reserves the right to exclude them from all or part of a trip without refund.<br>\nFor legal reasons our leaders and guides are prohibited from administering any type of drugs including headache tablets and antibiotics. Please ensure that you are adequately prepared.</p>\n<h4>Air &#x26; Lodging Reservations</h4>\n<p>We urge you to make your travel plans as soon as possible.

We suggest you pick the route Billund – Cluj-Napoca, operating with the lowest cost flight company such as WIZZ Air. You may choose to arrange the transportation to the departure city as you please, but do take into account that you have to be there at 12:30, on the first day of the tour.<br>\nIn case of a flight delay or external issues that might delay your arrival, contact us as soon as possible to plan the departure from Cluj-Napoca. Uncharted is not to be held responsible for any issues derived from the consumers failing to comply with this terms.</p>\n<h4>Passport and visas</h4>\n<p><strong>Citizens of the European Union countries</strong> can enter Romania with a <strong>valid passport</strong> or with their <strong>National Identity Card</strong>.<br>\nA valid passport is required for all overseas/non-EU visitors.Your passport must be valid for the entire duration of your visit (it will not expire sooner than your intended date of departure). However, please check the expiration date on your passport carefully before traveling to Europe.<br>\nTo apply for an extended stay visa please visit <a href=\"http://evisa.mae.ro/\">eVisa.MAE.ro.</a><br>\nFor additional information please contact the <a href=\"http://igi.mai.gov.ro/en\">Romanian Immigration Office.</a></p>\n<h4>Food and dietary requirements</h4>\n<p>Your tour includes meals as indicated in our brochure and online. Every day breakfast, lunch and dinner will be included. On some of the days, due to certain activities that require longer traveling distances, the lunch will be served either as a lunch-box or in a cosier manner such as a BBQ or a meal made by the shepherds.<br>\nAdventurers with special meal requirements or food allergies <strong>MUST</strong> ensure they or their travel agent has informed Uncharted IVS of this at the time of booking. We can make all the proper adjustments to ensure your dietary requirements are met, as long as we are informed in time.</p>\n<h4>Free Courses</h4>\n<p>Some of our activities might seem intimidating for people who never tried them before. Activities such as rock climbing for example. We want to help you overcome your fear and inhibitions and that is why we offer free courses for people who want to try this amazing activity.<br>\nIf you consider taking an adventure that has included rock climbing, but you are uncertain about it, write us an email and we will organise for you a free climbing session. There, you have an opportunity to try it out as well as to learn few basic techniques. Afterwards if you decide to buy the package, we throw in 4 more free climbing sessions where you will gain more experience and knowledge about the sport. All sessions will be held with our accredited trainer and instructor. (Note: This applies only for Aarhus commune residents)<br>\nFurthermore, in the winter season, for those of you who want to switch from skis to snowboard or simply want to learn how to slide down the mountain in the cool snowboarding way, we offer free snowboarding training for the period of your tour. You will be thought all the basics and who knows, maybe by the end of the adventure you will already be able to snowboard on your own.</p>\n<h4>Pocket Money</h4>\n<p>Romania still employs mostly cash payments; therefore, we recommend you do not fully rely on the possibility of paying with the credit card in all places.<br>\nThe currency in Romania is RON (1 RON = 1.62 DKK). Regarding pocket money, you have few options. The first one is to use your credit card and withdraw RON from the local ATM’s. Your tour guide will make sure to find the most suitable one for you with least exchange charges. The second option would be to bring cash (EURO) and change them at the exchange offices.<br>\nOur tours take us through villages and places where the only way to pay for souvenirs is with cash, therefore we strongly advise to have some cash with you at all time.</p>\n<h4>Equipment</h4>\n<p>Due to the fact that all tours consist of activities that involve nature and mountains, we strongly recommend that you have on you the following basic equipment at all times:  </p>\n<p>• Hiking boots<br>\n• Rain jacket<br>\n• Warm clothes, no matter the season.  </p>\n<p>Specific equipment for the different activities will be provided by Uncharted IVS or the partners. Therefore, all you need to think of is the equipment presented above. If by any chance, extra equipment is necessary, we will inform you, and if you do not have it we will do our best to provide you with the best alternative in order for you to be properly equipped for your adventure.</p>\n<h4>Group Leader and travel guides</h4>\n<p>All our adventure tours are accompanied by your group leader from Uncharted team. Your group leader is also your driver and on different activities he will be your instructor as well. The aim of the group leader is to take the hassle out of your travels and to help you have the best trip possible. The group leader will provide information on the places you are travelling through, offer suggestions for things to do and see and organise everything to ensure the best experience for you, the adventurer. He will also introduce you to our local friends along the way. While not being a guide in the traditional sense you can expect him to have a broad general knowledge of the areas visited on the trip, including historical, environmental, cultural and social aspects.  </p>\n<p>Your group leader was born and raised in the areas where the tours are being held, hence he knows every rock and tree surrounding the city of Sibiu. Moreover, he is a mountain sports enthusiast performing a variety of the mountain activities in the tour, in some of them being also specialised as a professional trainer and instructor:  </p>\n<p>• Rock Climbing trainer and instructor (activating within Aarhus Klatreklub);<br>\n• Ski and Snowboard instructor.  </p>\n<p>For other activities, our partners will provide us with the appropriate mountain guides and specific activities travel guides. All of them are experts in their fields, with lots of years of experience on their back. You can find them on our partners’ list.</p>\n<h4>Travelling on a group trip</h4>\n<p>As you travel on a group trip you will be exposed to all the pleasures and maybe some of the frustrations of travelling in a group. Your fellow adventurers will probably come from all corners of the world and likely a range of age groups too. We ask you to be understanding of the various needs and preferences of your group - patience with your fellow adventurers is sometimes required for the benefit of everyone's travel experience. Remember too that you have responsibilities to the group. If you are requested to be at a place at a certain time, ensure that you don't keep the rest of the group waiting.<br>\nTo ensure a great group environment, we will host an informal meeting, prior to the departure, where you will get the chance to know a bit about the people you will go on the adventure with. Due to privacy reasons however, we are unable to provide you with contact details and any personal information about your fellow adventurers booked on your trip prior to departure.</p>\n<h4>Sustainable traveling</h4>\n<p>Uncharted is all about making simple choices to reduce the negative impact on the destinations. Individually, each one of these choices makes only a small difference. But collectively, becoming more conscious about these little things can have a huge impact.  </p>\n<p>Whether you are passionate about supporting local communities or preserving wildlife and natural resources, there are plenty of ways you can do that. Here is a list of few ways you will make your impact, just by choosing our adventures:  </p>\n<p>• Our tours consist of a lot of walking in both the nature and urban regions. Often, we may add some biking trails in order to cover more ground, while still remaining conscious about the environment. Therefore, the transportation by car will be reduced to a bare minimum, hence cutting down on gas usage and pollution;<br>\n• Throughout the tour we will always stick to the marked paths, that are there for a reason. And that is to avoid harming native flora;<br>\n• We always keep respectful distance from wildlife. Even though we understand that a selfie with a brown bear or a wild deer could make a great Instagram story, if you are too close to attract the animal’s attention, then you are way too close;<br>\n• Our adventurers are always encouraged and guided towards buying local products rather than those which have been imported. Local artisans, manufacturers and producers are the people we encourage the souvenirs to be brought from. By this we help to preserve the culture, give back to the community and show you, the adventurer, the authenticity of the traditions and the local customs. Think, whether at the end of the day you want to buy an authentic souvenir or one that came straight from the Asian assembly line?<br>\n• All the adventures are held in small groups, up to 16 people. The reason behind is not only to create a cosy environment for the adventurers, but also to lessen the negative impact on the environment. Together we can show that tourism can be done in a responsible, sustainable manner.<br>\n• All elements in every tour are created in such way that in helps to immerse yourself in the local culture. The true definition of a travelling adventure is to get the chance to try different foods, listen to different music and explore different cultures. That is what we do here at Uncharted.</p>"}]}
