The Chemex Coffeemaker is a manual, pour-over style glass-container coffeemaker that Peter Schlumbohm invented in 1941, and which continues to be manufactured by the Chemex Corporation in Chicopee, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>In 1958, designers at the <a href=\"https://www.spacefarm.digital\">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> said that the Chemex Coffeemaker is <em>\"one of the best-designed products of modern times\"</em>, and so is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.</p>\n<h2>The little secrets of Chemex brewing</h2>\n<p>The Chemex Coffeemaker consists of an hourglass-shaped glass flask with a conical funnel-like neck (rather than the cylindrical neck of an Erlenmeyer flask) and uses proprietary filters, made of bonded paper (thicker-gauge paper than the standard paper filters for a drip-method coffeemaker) that removes most of the coffee oils, brewing coffee with a taste that is different than coffee brewed in other coffee-making systems; also, the thicker paper of the Chemex coffee filters may assist in removing cafestol, a cholesterol-containing compound found in coffee oils. Here’s three important tips newbies forget about:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Always buy dedicated Chemex filters.</li>\n<li>Use a scale, don’t try to eyeball it.</li>\n<li>Never skip preheating the glass.</li>\n<li>Timing is key, don’t forget the clock.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The most visually distinctive feature of the Chemex is the heatproof wooden collar around the neck, allowing it to be handled and poured when full of hot water. This is turned, then split in two to allow it to fit around the glass neck. The two pieces are held loosely in place by a tied leather thong. The pieces are not tied tightly and can still move slightly, retained by the shape of the conical glass.</p>\n<p>For a design piece that became popular post-war at a time of Modernism and precision manufacture, this juxtaposition of natural wood and the organic nature of a hand-tied knot with the laboratory nature of glassware was a distinctive feature of its appearance.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-5ca3e28813cf9da9e5ddafa99d32d2fa--","value":"<h2>The Package does not include:</h2>\n<p>•\tTransportation to the starting point of the tour, Cluj-Napoca t/r</p>\n<p>•\tTravel Insurance </p>\n<h2>Why we love this adventure?</h2>\n<p>•\tYour adventure is going to be unique.

It is the home of Blue Mountain coffee and their famous tours. It is located on the border of the Portland and Saint Thomas parishes of Jamaica.</p>\n<h2>A little history</h2>\n<p>The Blue Mountains are considered by many to be a hiker's and camper's paradise. The traditional Blue Mountain trek is a 7-mile hike to the peak and consists of a 3,000-foot increase in elevation. Jamaicans prefer to reach the peak at sunrise, thus the 3–4 hour hike is usually undertaken in darkness. Since the sky is usually very clear in the mornings, Cuba can be seen in the distance.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some of the plants found on the Blue Mountain cannot be found anywhere else in the world and they are often of a dwarfed sort.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is mainly due to the cold climate which inhibits growth. The small coffee farming communities of Claverty Cottage and Hagley Gap are located near the peak.</p>\n<h2>What you need to know before trying</h2>\n<p>Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee or Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee is a classification of coffee grown in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. The best lots of Blue Mountain coffee are noted for their mild flavor and lack of bitterness. Over the past few decades, this coffee has developed a reputation that has made it one of the most expensive and sought-after coffees in the world. Over 80% of all Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is exported to Japan. In addition to its use for brewed coffee, the beans are the flavor base of Tia Maria coffee liqueur.</p>\n<p>Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is a globally protected certification mark, meaning only coffee certified by the Coffee Industry Board of Jamaica can be labeled as such. It comes from a recognized growing region in the Blue Mountain region of Jamaica, and its cultivation is monitored by the Coffee Industry Board of Jamaica.</p>\n<p>The Blue Mountains are generally located between Kingston to the south and Port Antonio to the north. Rising 7,402 ft, they are some of the highest mountains in the Caribbean. The climate of the region is cool and misty with high rainfall. The soil is rich, with excellent drainage.

Once at the accommodation, all participants will be greeted with a traditional meal and the rest of the evening will be dedicated to resting and getting to know each other.</p>\n<h3>Day 2 - Hiking in the 7 Ladder Canyon, Offroad 4x4</h3>\n<p>The second day will start by heading towards the Carpathian Mountains, more precisely the Bucegi Mountains Sector. We will start with an easy hike towards the 7 Ladders Canyon, followed by traversing the canyon in a unique style. The hike will end in a picnic on the top of the canyon, after we will continue discovering the Carpathians with a 4x4 off-road tour. We will travel over high ground, through forest and woodland on various difficulty tracks, making for a great experience. Along the way, we will stop for a cosy picnic in a breath-taking view spot. Make sure your phones and photo cameras are fully charged to take proper advantage of the amazing landscapes</p>\n<p>The day will end with dinner at the accommodation and some quality group time involving games and of course traditional beverages. </p>\n<h3>Day 3 – Hike and lunch at traditional sheepfold</h3>\n<p>Our day starts with the transfer to the bottom of the Cindrel mountains, from where we will start climbing up on a narrow shady path that leads us to an alpine glade; from here, we’ll continue our route till we reach the imposing mountaintops of the Cindrel massif. On the edge of the soft summit lies a traditional picturesque sheepfold. \n It’s the perfect place to have a rest, enjoy the astonishing view and learn about the daily simple life of the shepherds. For lunch we will savour the delicious lamb and milk specialties skilfully prepared by the shepherds: different types of cheese (telemea, caş, urdă, burduf, jintiţă), pastrami and bacon, are just a few of the delicious products that, together with the “golden” polenta shall make you drool over.\n Of course, all of these shall be accompanied by a sip of schnapps or a glass of red wine.   </p>\n<h3>Day 4 – Adventure park, Treasure Hunt, Spa</h3>\n<p>The morning will be a new kind of forest experience, as the participants will move from tree to tree, above the ground, in the famous adventurepark, Arka Park.  The afternoon will be dedicated on experiencing the historical city of Sibiu in a fun and interactive way. A treasure hunt will be organized, where the participants will discover the historical city centre of the 2007 European Capital of Culture by following an interactive set of clues. Each clue will lead you to an emblematic place for the history of Sibiu.</p>\n<p>After traversing the forest from tree to tree and discovering the city of Sibiu, the rest of the day will be dedicated towards a relaxing experience at a spa. </p>\n<h3>Day 5 – Culture, Traditions and Gastronomy Tour</h3>\n<p>Our day trip takes you to some lovely villages around Sibiu, in the Mărginime area, at the foothill of the Cindrel Mountains, part of the Southern Carpathians. You’ll get to experience the specific rural gastronomy and taste some of the most representative products of our region.

In that case, the customer (adventurer) shall be entitled to a refund of all amounts paid under the contract.<br>\nThe upper paragraph shall not apply if the event in question was known to the customer (adventurer) on the conclusion of the contract or if the event was generally known.<br>\nThe organizer (Uncharted) shall notify the customer (adventurer) of the cancellation terms prior to the conclusion of the contract.<br>\nPrior to the conclusion of the contract, the organizer shall notify the customer (adventurer) of the possibilities and terms of taking out insurance to cover the customer's non-participation in the package tour due to illness or similar.</p>\n<h4>Travel Insurance</h4>\n<p>Because the outdoor activities imply a certain risk of injury, we strongly advise you to purchase travel insurance. We recommend that you contact your insurance broker and ask for the suitable insurance for the chosen tour.<br>\nTravel insurance is compulsory for all our trips. We require that, at a minimum, you are covered for medical expenses including emergency repatriation. We strongly recommend that the policy also covers personal liability, curtailment and loss of luggage and personal effects.<br>\nIt is the adventurer’s own responsibility to ensure they purchase a travel insurance. Uncharted IVS is not to be held liable in case of any accidents that could have been covered by the travel insurance.</p>\n<h4>Medical and health information</h4>\n<p>All Uncharted adventurers need to be in a good physical health in order to fully participate on any of the activities. Please make sure you have read through the itinerary carefully when selecting your adventure and assess your ability to cope with our style of travel. Please note that if, in the opinion of our group leader or local guide, any adventurer is unable to complete the itinerary without undue risk to themselves and/or the rest of the group, Uncharted IVS reserves the right to exclude them from all or part of a trip without refund.<br>\nFor legal reasons our leaders and guides are prohibited from administering any type of drugs including headache tablets and antibiotics. Please ensure that you are adequately prepared.</p>\n<h4>Air &#x26; Lodging Reservations</h4>\n<p>We urge you to make your travel plans as soon as possible. All tours are planned around the cheapest flight tickets to the departure city of Cluj-Napoca. We suggest you pick the route Billund – Cluj-Napoca, operating with the lowest cost flight company such as WIZZ Air. You may choose to arrange the transportation to the departure city as you please, but do take into account that you have to be there at 12:30, on the first day of the tour.<br>\nIn case of a flight delay or external issues that might delay your arrival, contact us as soon as possible to plan the departure from Cluj-Napoca. Uncharted is not to be held responsible for any issues derived from the consumers failing to comply with this terms.</p>\n<h4>Passport and visas</h4>\n<p><strong>Citizens of the European Union countries</strong> can enter Romania with a <strong>valid passport</strong> or with their <strong>National Identity Card</strong>.<br>\nA valid passport is required for all overseas/non-EU visitors.Your passport must be valid for the entire duration of your visit (it will not expire sooner than your intended date of departure). However, please check the expiration date on your passport carefully before traveling to Europe.<br>\nTo apply for an extended stay visa please visit <a href=\"http://evisa.mae.ro/\">eVisa.MAE.ro.</a><br>\nFor additional information please contact the <a href=\"http://igi.mai.gov.ro/en\">Romanian Immigration Office.</a></p>\n<h4>Food and dietary requirements</h4>\n<p>Your tour includes meals as indicated in our brochure and online. Every day breakfast, lunch and dinner will be included. On some of the days, due to certain activities that require longer traveling distances, the lunch will be served either as a lunch-box or in a cosier manner such as a BBQ or a meal made by the shepherds.<br>\nAdventurers with special meal requirements or food allergies <strong>MUST</strong> ensure they or their travel agent has informed Uncharted IVS of this at the time of booking. We can make all the proper adjustments to ensure your dietary requirements are met, as long as we are informed in time.</p>\n<h4>Free Courses</h4>\n<p>Some of our activities might seem intimidating for people who never tried them before. Activities such as rock climbing for example. We want to help you overcome your fear and inhibitions and that is why we offer free courses for people who want to try this amazing activity.<br>\nIf you consider taking an adventure that has included rock climbing, but you are uncertain about it, write us an email and we will organise for you a free climbing session. There, you have an opportunity to try it out as well as to learn few basic techniques. Afterwards if you decide to buy the package, we throw in 4 more free climbing sessions where you will gain more experience and knowledge about the sport. All sessions will be held with our accredited trainer and instructor. (Note: This applies only for Aarhus commune residents)<br>\nFurthermore, in the winter season, for those of you who want to switch from skis to snowboard or simply want to learn how to slide down the mountain in the cool snowboarding way, we offer free snowboarding training for the period of your tour. You will be thought all the basics and who knows, maybe by the end of the adventure you will already be able to snowboard on your own.</p>\n<h4>Pocket Money</h4>\n<p>Romania still employs mostly cash payments; therefore, we recommend you do not fully rely on the possibility of paying with the credit card in all places.<br>\nThe currency in Romania is RON (1 RON = 1.62 DKK). Regarding pocket money, you have few options. The first one is to use your credit card and withdraw RON from the local ATM’s. Your tour guide will make sure to find the most suitable one for you with least exchange charges. The second option would be to bring cash (EURO) and change them at the exchange offices.<br>\nOur tours take us through villages and places where the only way to pay for souvenirs is with cash, therefore we strongly advise to have some cash with you at all time.</p>\n<h4>Equipment</h4>\n<p>Due to the fact that all tours consist of activities that involve nature and mountains, we strongly recommend that you have on you the following basic equipment at all times:  </p>\n<p>• Hiking boots<br>\n• Rain jacket<br>\n• Warm clothes, no matter the season.  </p>\n<p>Specific equipment for the different activities will be provided by Uncharted IVS or the partners. Therefore, all you need to think of is the equipment presented above. If by any chance, extra equipment is necessary, we will inform you, and if you do not have it we will do our best to provide you with the best alternative in order for you to be properly equipped for your adventure.</p>\n<h4>Group Leader and travel guides</h4>\n<p>All our adventure tours are accompanied by your group leader from Uncharted team. Your group leader is also your driver and on different activities he will be your instructor as well. The aim of the group leader is to take the hassle out of your travels and to help you have the best trip possible. The group leader will provide information on the places you are travelling through, offer suggestions for things to do and see and organise everything to ensure the best experience for you, the adventurer. He will also introduce you to our local friends along the way. While not being a guide in the traditional sense you can expect him to have a broad general knowledge of the areas visited on the trip, including historical, environmental, cultural and social aspects.  </p>\n<p>Your group leader was born and raised in the areas where the tours are being held, hence he knows every rock and tree surrounding the city of Sibiu. Moreover, he is a mountain sports enthusiast performing a variety of the mountain activities in the tour, in some of them being also specialised as a professional trainer and instructor:  </p>\n<p>• Rock Climbing trainer and instructor (activating within Aarhus Klatreklub);<br>\n• Ski and Snowboard instructor.  </p>\n<p>For other activities, our partners will provide us with the appropriate mountain guides and specific activities travel guides. All of them are experts in their fields, with lots of years of experience on their back. You can find them on our partners’ list.</p>\n<h4>Travelling on a group trip</h4>\n<p>As you travel on a group trip you will be exposed to all the pleasures and maybe some of the frustrations of travelling in a group. Your fellow adventurers will probably come from all corners of the world and likely a range of age groups too. We ask you to be understanding of the various needs and preferences of your group - patience with your fellow adventurers is sometimes required for the benefit of everyone's travel experience. Remember too that you have responsibilities to the group.

Individually, each one of these choices makes only a small difference. But collectively, becoming more conscious about these little things can have a huge impact.  </p>\n<p>Whether you are passionate about supporting local communities or preserving wildlife and natural resources, there are plenty of ways you can do that.

In that case, the customer (adventurer) shall be entitled to a refund of all amounts paid under the contract.<br>\nThe upper paragraph shall not apply if the event in question was known to the customer (adventurer) on the conclusion of the contract or if the event was generally known.<br>\nThe organizer (Uncharted) shall notify the customer (adventurer) of the cancellation terms prior to the conclusion of the contract.<br>\nPrior to the conclusion of the contract, the organizer shall notify the customer (adventurer) of the possibilities and terms of taking out insurance to cover the customer's non-participation in the package tour due to illness or similar.</p>\n<h4>Travel Insurance</h4>\n<p>Because the outdoor activities imply a certain risk of injury, we strongly advise you to purchase travel insurance. We recommend that you contact your insurance broker and ask for the suitable insurance for the chosen tour.<br>\nTravel insurance is compulsory for all our trips. We require that, at a minimum, you are covered for medical expenses including emergency repatriation. We strongly recommend that the policy also covers personal liability, curtailment and loss of luggage and personal effects.<br>\nIt is the adventurer’s own responsibility to ensure they purchase a travel insurance. Uncharted IVS is not to be held liable in case of any accidents that could have been covered by the travel insurance.</p>\n<h4>Medical and health information</h4>\n<p>All Uncharted adventurers need to be in a good physical health in order to fully participate on any of the activities. Please make sure you have read through the itinerary carefully when selecting your adventure and assess your ability to cope with our style of travel. Please note that if, in the opinion of our group leader or local guide, any adventurer is unable to complete the itinerary without undue risk to themselves and/or the rest of the group, Uncharted IVS reserves the right to exclude them from all or part of a trip without refund.<br>\nFor legal reasons our leaders and guides are prohibited from administering any type of drugs including headache tablets and antibiotics. Please ensure that you are adequately prepared.</p>\n<h4>Air &#x26; Lodging Reservations</h4>\n<p>We urge you to make your travel plans as soon as possible. All tours are planned around the cheapest flight tickets to the departure city of Cluj-Napoca. We suggest you pick the route Billund – Cluj-Napoca, operating with the lowest cost flight company such as WIZZ Air. You may choose to arrange the transportation to the departure city as you please, but do take into account that you have to be there at 12:30, on the first day of the tour.<br>\nIn case of a flight delay or external issues that might delay your arrival, contact us as soon as possible to plan the departure from Cluj-Napoca. Uncharted is not to be held responsible for any issues derived from the consumers failing to comply with this terms.</p>\n<h4>Passport and visas</h4>\n<p><strong>Citizens of the European Union countries</strong> can enter Romania with a <strong>valid passport</strong> or with their <strong>National Identity Card</strong>.<br>\nA valid passport is required for all overseas/non-EU visitors.Your passport must be valid for the entire duration of your visit (it will not expire sooner than your intended date of departure). However, please check the expiration date on your passport carefully before traveling to Europe.<br>\nTo apply for an extended stay visa please visit <a href=\"http://evisa.mae.ro/\">eVisa.MAE.ro.</a><br>\nFor additional information please contact the <a href=\"http://igi.mai.gov.ro/en\">Romanian Immigration Office.</a></p>\n<h4>Food and dietary requirements</h4>\n<p>Your tour includes meals as indicated in our brochure and online. Every day breakfast, lunch and dinner will be included. On some of the days, due to certain activities that require longer traveling distances, the lunch will be served either as a lunch-box or in a cosier manner such as a BBQ or a meal made by the shepherds.<br>\nAdventurers with special meal requirements or food allergies <strong>MUST</strong> ensure they or their travel agent has informed Uncharted IVS of this at the time of booking. We can make all the proper adjustments to ensure your dietary requirements are met, as long as we are informed in time.</p>\n<h4>Free Courses</h4>\n<p>Some of our activities might seem intimidating for people who never tried them before. Activities such as rock climbing for example. We want to help you overcome your fear and inhibitions and that is why we offer free courses for people who want to try this amazing activity.<br>\nIf you consider taking an adventure that has included rock climbing, but you are uncertain about it, write us an email and we will organise for you a free climbing session. There, you have an opportunity to try it out as well as to learn few basic techniques. Afterwards if you decide to buy the package, we throw in 4 more free climbing sessions where you will gain more experience and knowledge about the sport. All sessions will be held with our accredited trainer and instructor. (Note: This applies only for Aarhus commune residents)<br>\nFurthermore, in the winter season, for those of you who want to switch from skis to snowboard or simply want to learn how to slide down the mountain in the cool snowboarding way, we offer free snowboarding training for the period of your tour. You will be thought all the basics and who knows, maybe by the end of the adventure you will already be able to snowboard on your own.</p>\n<h4>Pocket Money</h4>\n<p>Romania still employs mostly cash payments; therefore, we recommend you do not fully rely on the possibility of paying with the credit card in all places.<br>\nThe currency in Romania is RON (1 RON = 1.62 DKK). Regarding pocket money, you have few options. The first one is to use your credit card and withdraw RON from the local ATM’s. Your tour guide will make sure to find the most suitable one for you with least exchange charges. The second option would be to bring cash (EURO) and change them at the exchange offices.<br>\nOur tours take us through villages and places where the only way to pay for souvenirs is with cash, therefore we strongly advise to have some cash with you at all time.</p>\n<h4>Equipment</h4>\n<p>Due to the fact that all tours consist of activities that involve nature and mountains, we strongly recommend that you have on you the following basic equipment at all times:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Hiking boots  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rain jacket  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Warm clothes, no matter the season.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Specific equipment for the different activities will be provided by Uncharted IVS or the partners. Therefore, all you need to think of is the equipment presented above. If by any chance, extra equipment is necessary, we will inform you, and if you do not have it we will do our best to provide you with the best alternative in order for you to be properly equipped for your adventure.</p>\n<h4>Group Leader and travel guides</h4>\n<p>All our adventure tours are accompanied by your group leader from Uncharted team. Your group leader is also your driver and on different activities he will be your instructor as well. The aim of the group leader is to take the hassle out of your travels and to help you have the best trip possible. The group leader will provide information on the places you are travelling through, offer suggestions for things to do and see and organise everything to ensure the best experience for you, the adventurer. He will also introduce you to our local friends along the way. While not being a guide in the traditional sense you can expect him to have a broad general knowledge of the areas visited on the trip, including historical, environmental, cultural and social aspects.  </p>\n<p>Your group leader was born and raised in the areas where the tours are being held, hence he knows every rock and tree surrounding the city of Sibiu. Moreover, he is a mountain sports enthusiast performing a variety of the mountain activities in the tour, in some of them being also specialised as a professional trainer and instructor:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Rock Climbing trainer and instructor (activating within Aarhus Klatreklub);  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ski and Snowboard instructor.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For other activities, our partners will provide us with the appropriate mountain guides and specific activities travel guides. All of them are experts in their fields, with lots of years of experience on their back. You can find them on our partners’ list.</p>\n<h4>Travelling on a group trip</h4>\n<p>As you travel on a group trip you will be exposed to all the pleasures and maybe some of the frustrations of travelling in a group. Your fellow adventurers will probably come from all corners of the world and likely a range of age groups too. We ask you to be understanding of the various needs and preferences of your group - patience with your fellow adventurers is sometimes required for the benefit of everyone's travel experience. Remember too that you have responsibilities to the group. If you are requested to be at a place at a certain time, ensure that you don't keep the rest of the group waiting.<br>\nTo ensure a great group environment, we will host an informal meeting, prior to the departure, where you will get the chance to know a bit about the people you will go on the adventure with. Due to privacy reasons however, we are unable to provide you with contact details and any personal information about your fellow adventurers booked on your trip prior to departure.</p>\n<h4>Sustainable traveling</h4>\n<p>Uncharted is all about making simple choices to reduce the negative impact on the destinations. Individually, each one of these choices makes only a small difference. But collectively, becoming more conscious about these little things can have a huge impact.  </p>\n<p>Whether you are passionate about supporting local communities or preserving wildlife and natural resources, there are plenty of ways you can do that. Here is a list of few ways you will make your impact, just by choosing our adventures:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our tours consist of a lot of walking in both the nature and urban regions. Often, we may add some biking trails in order to cover more ground, while still remaining conscious about the environment. Therefore, the transportation by car will be reduced to a bare minimum, hence cutting down on gas usage and pollution;  </li>\n<li>Throughout the tour we will always stick to the marked paths, that are there for a reason. And that is to avoid harming native flora;  </li>\n<li>We always keep respectful distance from wildlife. Even though we understand that a selfie with a brown bear or a wild deer could make a great Instagram story, if you are too close to attract the animal’s attention, then you are way too close;  </li>\n<li>Our adventurers are always encouraged and guided towards buying local products rather than those which have been imported. Local artisans, manufacturers and producers are the people we encourage the souvenirs to be brought from. By this we help to preserve the culture, give back to the community and show you, the adventurer, the authenticity of the traditions and the local customs. Think, whether at the end of the day you want to buy an authentic souvenir or one that came straight from the Asian assembly line?  </li>\n<li>All the adventures are held in small groups, up to 16 people. The reason behind is not only to create a cosy environment for the adventurers, but also to lessen the negative impact on the environment. Together we can show that tourism can be done in a responsible, sustainable manner.  </li>\n<li>All elements in every tour are created in such way that in helps to immerse yourself in the local culture. The true definition of a travelling adventure is to get the chance to try different foods, listen to different music and explore different cultures. That is what we do here at Uncharted.</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-b63d83a99263c073c3fdf27a50483cfa--","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"templateKey: package\ntitle: The Shepherd's Getaway\ntagline: Find yourself in the natural wonders of Transylvania.\nimage: /img/untitled-57.jpg\nprice: 4.250 DKK\nlenght: 3 days","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":9,"column":4,"offset":182},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"The word shepherd stands for old traditions, mountain activities and of course\ndelicious and healthy food.

In that case, the customer (adventurer) shall be entitled to a refund of all amounts paid under the contract.<br>\nThe upper paragraph shall not apply if the event in question was known to the customer (adventurer) on the conclusion of the contract or if the event was generally known.<br>\nThe organizer (Uncharted) shall notify the customer (adventurer) of the cancellation terms prior to the conclusion of the contract.<br>\nPrior to the conclusion of the contract, the organizer shall notify the customer (adventurer) of the possibilities and terms of taking out insurance to cover the customer's non-participation in the package tour due to illness or similar.</p>\n<h4>Travel Insurance</h4>\n<p>Because the outdoor activities imply a certain risk of injury, we strongly advise you to purchase travel insurance. We recommend that you contact your insurance broker and ask for the suitable insurance for the chosen tour.<br>\nTravel insurance is compulsory for all our trips. We require that, at a minimum, you are covered for medical expenses including emergency repatriation. We strongly recommend that the policy also covers personal liability, curtailment and loss of luggage and personal effects.<br>\nIt is the adventurer’s own responsibility to ensure they purchase a travel insurance. Uncharted IVS is not to be held liable in case of any accidents that could have been covered by the travel insurance.</p>\n<h4>Medical and health information</h4>\n<p>All Uncharted adventurers need to be in a good physical health in order to fully participate on any of the activities. Please make sure you have read through the itinerary carefully when selecting your adventure and assess your ability to cope with our style of travel. Please note that if, in the opinion of our group leader or local guide, any adventurer is unable to complete the itinerary without undue risk to themselves and/or the rest of the group, Uncharted IVS reserves the right to exclude them from all or part of a trip without refund.<br>\nFor legal reasons our leaders and guides are prohibited from administering any type of drugs including headache tablets and antibiotics. Please ensure that you are adequately prepared.</p>\n<h4>Air &#x26; Lodging Reservations</h4>\n<p>We urge you to make your travel plans as soon as possible. All tours are planned around the cheapest flight tickets to the departure city of Cluj-Napoca. We suggest you pick the route Billund – Cluj-Napoca, operating with the lowest cost flight company such as WIZZ Air. You may choose to arrange the transportation to the departure city as you please, but do take into account that you have to be there at 12:30, on the first day of the tour.<br>\nIn case of a flight delay or external issues that might delay your arrival, contact us as soon as possible to plan the departure from Cluj-Napoca. Uncharted is not to be held responsible for any issues derived from the consumers failing to comply with this terms.</p>\n<h4>Passport and visas</h4>\n<p><strong>Citizens of the European Union countries</strong> can enter Romania with a <strong>valid passport</strong> or with their <strong>National Identity Card</strong>.<br>\nA valid passport is required for all overseas/non-EU visitors.Your passport must be valid for the entire duration of your visit (it will not expire sooner than your intended date of departure). However, please check the expiration date on your passport carefully before traveling to Europe.<br>\nTo apply for an extended stay visa please visit <a href=\"http://evisa.mae.ro/\">eVisa.MAE.ro.</a><br>\nFor additional information please contact the <a href=\"http://igi.mai.gov.ro/en\">Romanian Immigration Office.</a></p>\n<h4>Food and dietary requirements</h4>\n<p>Your tour includes meals as indicated in our brochure and online. Every day breakfast, lunch and dinner will be included. On some of the days, due to certain activities that require longer traveling distances, the lunch will be served either as a lunch-box or in a cosier manner such as a BBQ or a meal made by the shepherds.<br>\nAdventurers with special meal requirements or food allergies <strong>MUST</strong> ensure they or their travel agent has informed Uncharted IVS of this at the time of booking. We can make all the proper adjustments to ensure your dietary requirements are met, as long as we are informed in time.</p>\n<h4>Free Courses</h4>\n<p>Some of our activities might seem intimidating for people who never tried them before. Activities such as rock climbing for example. We want to help you overcome your fear and inhibitions and that is why we offer free courses for people who want to try this amazing activity.<br>\nIf you consider taking an adventure that has included rock climbing, but you are uncertain about it, write us an email and we will organise for you a free climbing session. There, you have an opportunity to try it out as well as to learn few basic techniques. Afterwards if you decide to buy the package, we throw in 4 more free climbing sessions where you will gain more experience and knowledge about the sport. All sessions will be held with our accredited trainer and instructor. (Note: This applies only for Aarhus commune residents)<br>\nFurthermore, in the winter season, for those of you who want to switch from skis to snowboard or simply want to learn how to slide down the mountain in the cool snowboarding way, we offer free snowboarding training for the period of your tour. You will be thought all the basics and who knows, maybe by the end of the adventure you will already be able to snowboard on your own.</p>\n<h4>Pocket Money</h4>\n<p>Romania still employs mostly cash payments; therefore, we recommend you do not fully rely on the possibility of paying with the credit card in all places.<br>\nThe currency in Romania is RON (1 RON = 1.62 DKK). Regarding pocket money, you have few options. The first one is to use your credit card and withdraw RON from the local ATM’s. Your tour guide will make sure to find the most suitable one for you with least exchange charges. The second option would be to bring cash (EURO) and change them at the exchange offices.<br>\nOur tours take us through villages and places where the only way to pay for souvenirs is with cash, therefore we strongly advise to have some cash with you at all time.</p>\n<h4>Equipment</h4>\n<p>Due to the fact that all tours consist of activities that involve nature and mountains, we strongly recommend that you have on you the following basic equipment at all times:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Hiking boots  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rain jacket  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Warm clothes, no matter the season.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Specific equipment for the different activities will be provided by Uncharted IVS or the partners. Therefore, all you need to think of is the equipment presented above. If by any chance, extra equipment is necessary, we will inform you, and if you do not have it we will do our best to provide you with the best alternative in order for you to be properly equipped for your adventure.</p>\n<h4>Group Leader and travel guides</h4>\n<p>All our adventure tours are accompanied by your group leader from Uncharted team.
