We recommend that you contact your insurance broker and ask for the suitable insurance for the chosen tour.<br>\nTravel insurance is compulsory for all our trips. We require that, at a minimum, you are covered for medical expenses including emergency repatriation. We strongly recommend that the policy also covers personal liability, curtailment and loss of luggage and personal effects.<br>\nIt is the adventurer’s own responsibility to ensure they purchase a travel insurance. Uncharted IVS is not to be held liable in case of any accidents that could have been covered by the travel insurance.</p>\n<h4>Medical and health information</h4>\n<p>All Uncharted adventurers need to be in a good physical health in order to fully participate on any of the activities. Please make sure you have read through the itinerary carefully when selecting your adventure and assess your ability to cope with our style of travel. Please note that if, in the opinion of our group leader or local guide, any adventurer is unable to complete the itinerary without undue risk to themselves and/or the rest of the group, Uncharted IVS reserves the right to exclude them from all or part of a trip without refund.<br>\nFor legal reasons our leaders and guides are prohibited from administering any type of drugs including headache tablets and antibiotics. Please ensure that you are adequately prepared.</p>\n<h4>Air &#x26; Lodging Reservations</h4>\n<p>We urge you to make your travel plans as soon as possible. All tours are planned around the cheapest flight tickets to the departure city of Cluj-Napoca. We suggest you pick the route Billund – Cluj-Napoca, operating with the lowest cost flight company such as WIZZ Air. You may choose to arrange the transportation to the departure city as you please, but do take into account that you have to be there at 12:30, on the first day of the tour.<br>\nIn case of a flight delay or external issues that might delay your arrival, contact us as soon as possible to plan the departure from Cluj-Napoca. Uncharted is not to be held responsible for any issues derived from the consumers failing to comply with this terms.</p>\n<h4>Passport and visas</h4>\n<p><strong>Citizens of the European Union countries</strong> can enter Romania with a <strong>valid passport</strong> or with their <strong>National Identity Card</strong>.<br>\nA valid passport is required for all overseas/non-EU visitors.Your passport must be valid for the entire duration of your visit (it will not expire sooner than your intended date of departure). However, please check the expiration date on your passport carefully before traveling to Europe.<br>\nTo apply for an extended stay visa please visit <a href=\"http://evisa.mae.ro/\">eVisa.MAE.ro.</a><br>\nFor additional information please contact the <a href=\"http://igi.mai.gov.ro/en\">Romanian Immigration Office.</a></p>\n<h4>Food and dietary requirements</h4>\n<p>Your tour includes meals as indicated in our brochure and online. Every day breakfast, lunch and dinner will be included. On some of the days, due to certain activities that require longer traveling distances, the lunch will be served either as a lunch-box or in a cosier manner such as a BBQ or a meal made by the shepherds.<br>\nAdventurers with special meal requirements or food allergies <strong>MUST</strong> ensure they or their travel agent has informed Uncharted IVS of this at the time of booking. We can make all the proper adjustments to ensure your dietary requirements are met, as long as we are informed in time.</p>\n<h4>Free Courses</h4>\n<p>Some of our activities might seem intimidating for people who never tried them before. Activities such as rock climbing for example. We want to help you overcome your fear and inhibitions and that is why we offer free courses for people who want to try this amazing activity.<br>\nIf you consider taking an adventure that has included rock climbing, but you are uncertain about it, write us an email and we will organise for you a free climbing session. There, you have an opportunity to try it out as well as to learn few basic techniques. Afterwards if you decide to buy the package, we throw in 4 more free climbing sessions where you will gain more experience and knowledge about the sport. All sessions will be held with our accredited trainer and instructor. (Note: This applies only for Aarhus commune residents)<br>\nFurthermore, in the winter season, for those of you who want to switch from skis to snowboard or simply want to learn how to slide down the mountain in the cool snowboarding way, we offer free snowboarding training for the period of your tour. You will be thought all the basics and who knows, maybe by the end of the adventure you will already be able to snowboard on your own.</p>\n<h4>Pocket Money</h4>\n<p>Romania still employs mostly cash payments; therefore, we recommend you do not fully rely on the possibility of paying with the credit card in all places.<br>\nThe currency in Romania is RON (1 RON = 1.62 DKK). Regarding pocket money, you have few options. The first one is to use your credit card and withdraw RON from the local ATM’s. Your tour guide will make sure to find the most suitable one for you with least exchange charges. The second option would be to bring cash (EURO) and change them at the exchange offices.<br>\nOur tours take us through villages and places where the only way to pay for souvenirs is with cash, therefore we strongly advise to have some cash with you at all time.</p>\n<h4>Equipment</h4>\n<p>Due to the fact that all tours consist of activities that involve nature and mountains, we strongly recommend that you have on you the following basic equipment at all times:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Hiking boots  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rain jacket  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Warm clothes, no matter the season.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Specific equipment for the different activities will be provided by Uncharted IVS or the partners.

Individually, each one of these choices makes only a small difference. But collectively, becoming more conscious about these little things can have a huge impact.  </p>\n<p>Whether you are passionate about supporting local communities or preserving wildlife and natural resources, there are plenty of ways you can do that. Here is a list of few ways you will make your impact, just by choosing our adventures:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our tours consist of a lot of walking in both the nature and urban regions. Often, we may add some biking trails in order to cover more ground, while still remaining conscious about the environment. Therefore, the transportation by car will be reduced to a bare minimum, hence cutting down on gas usage and pollution;  </li>\n<li>Throughout the tour we will always stick to the marked paths, that are there for a reason. And that is to avoid harming native flora;  </li>\n<li>We always keep respectful distance from wildlife. Even though we understand that a selfie with a brown bear or a wild deer could make a great Instagram story, if you are too close to attract the animal’s attention, then you are way too close;  </li>\n<li>Our adventurers are always encouraged and guided towards buying local products rather than those which have been imported. Local artisans, manufacturers and producers are the people we encourage the souvenirs to be brought from. By this we help to preserve the culture, give back to the community and show you, the adventurer, the authenticity of the traditions and the local customs. Think, whether at the end of the day you want to buy an authentic souvenir or one that came straight from the Asian assembly line?  </li>\n<li>All the adventures are held in small groups, up to 16 people. The reason behind is not only to create a cosy environment for the adventurers, but also to lessen the negative impact on the environment. Together we can show that tourism can be done in a responsible, sustainable manner.  </li>\n<li>All elements in every tour are created in such way that in helps to immerse yourself in the local culture. The true definition of a travelling adventure is to get the chance to try different foods, listen to different music and explore different cultures. That is what we do here at Uncharted.</li>\n</ul>"}]}
