But do not worry, more than 30% of Romanians speak English and French, also around 7% speak German (especially in Transylvania where there are lots of Saxons).</p>\n<h2>Do I need passport or national ID to travel to Romania?</h2>\n<p>It is just a matter of what you prefer, since Romania is in the EU. Therefore, either one of them will be sufficient to pass the border to Dracula’s Land. Though, we would suggest you bring both and keep them in separate storage places. In the unfortunate case you might loose one of the documents, you will have the other one to travel back without the extra bother.</p>\n<h2>What time zone is Romania in?</h2>\n<p>Romania uses the Eastern European Time Zone, UTC+02:00.</p>\n<h2>What’s the weather like in Romania?</h2>\n<p>Summers are generally very warm to hot, with average maxima being around 29 °C (84.2 °F), with temperatures over 35 °C (95 °F) not unknown in the lower-lying areas of the country. </p>\n<p>Winters are quite cold, with average highs even in lower-lying areas being no more than 3 °C (37.4 °F) and below −15 °C (5 °F) in the highest mountains, where some areas of permafrost occur on the highest peaks.</p>\n<h2>What are the opening hours in Romania?</h2>\n<p>• Banks: 9 am – 5 pm.</p>\n<p>• Malls: 10 am – 10 pm.</p>\n<p>• Drugstores: 8 am – 9 pm from Monday to Friday. On Saturdays, they are usually open until 4 pm and most of them are closed on Sundays, but every city has at least one drug store that is open 24/7.</p>\n<p>• Cafes, restaurants and other eat&#x26;drink places: 9 am – 10 pm from Monday to Friday and 11 am – 24 pm during weekends. Some local places stay open until the last client, but the program usually varies depending on the restaurant policy.</p>\n<p>• Supermarkets: 7 am – 10 pm. There are also several supermarkets with a 24h program.</p>\n<h2>Can I create my private group adventure?</h2>\n<p>Not only that you can, we strongly advise you to take advantage of our “customize your adventure” option. We regularly organise tailor-made adventures for families, groups of friends, couples and solo adventurers. As a general rule, for the adventure to take place, you need a minimum of 4 people in your group. </p>\n<h2>Who will be my traveling companions?</h2>\n<p>Part of small group travel means that although travellers come from various locations and backgrounds, you will be travelling with like-minded companions who, like you, are keen to share the experience and forge lifelong friendships.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h1>MONEY</h1>\n<h2>What is the Romanian currency?</h2>\n<p>Romania still employs mostly cash payments; therefore, we recommend you do not fully rely on the possibility of paying with the credit card in all places.  The currency in Romania is RON (1 RON = 1.62 DKK). Regarding pocket money, you have few options. The first one is to use your credit card and withdraw RON from the local ATM’s. Your tour leader will make sure to find the most suitable one for you with least exchange charges. The second option would be to bring cash (EURO) and change them at the exchange offices.  Our tours take us through villages and places where the only way to pay for souvenirs is with cash, therefore we strongly advise to have some cash with you at all time.</p>\n<h2>How is the price for the usual “day to day” expenses, such as beer?</h2>\n<p>Here are some prices that you will usually encounter:</p>\n<p>• A pine of beer (0.5L) – 4 - 10 lei - 16 kr.</p>\n<p>• A cup of coffee – 8-10 lei – 13 kr.</p>\n<p>• A glass of wine – 15 lei – 25 kr.</p>\n<p>• Pack of cigarettes – 17 lei – 28 kr.</p>\n<p>• Taxi– 2 - 2.5lei/km – 3 kr.</p>\n<p>• Public transportation ticket – 2 lei – 3 kr.</p>\n<p>• A small pizza – 27 lei – 43 kr.</p>\n<h2>Is tipping customary in Romania?</h2>\n<p>Well let me put it this way, it is not a must but it is a great way to show how much you appreciated the service you received. Tips are usual for taxi drivers, tour guides, waiters, or hotel staff. Usually, a tipping around 10% is sufficient, but if the service was really great, feel free to empty the pockets. At restaurants, the tip is usually not included in the bill.</p>\n<h1>Health &#x26; Safety</h1>\n<h2>Do I need a health insurance?</h2>\n<p>Even though traveling to Romania doesn’t require any immunization due to the lack of infections and poisonous insects, we highly recommend getting health insurance before visiting us. Better safe than sorry.</p>\n<h2>Is it safe to drink tap water?</h2>\n<p>Usually, the tap water is considered safe to drink in Romania. But be careful about the waters found in fountains – you should never drink it without purifying or boiling it first unless assured that it’s safe to drink by a guide or the local authority.</p>\n<h2>What number should I dial in case of an emergency?</h2>\n<p>If you have an emergency you can call 112 from any phone, even if you don’t have a sim card.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-ast-676454463c224a01f53251702aba2f32--","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Keep scrolling, you are on the right path to a wild adventure"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Let us guide you on your adventure path"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/img/my-post-8-.png","alt":"null"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<form></form>"},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<slider>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsiemanko11%2Fposts%2F1628853980479688%3A0&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"430\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fasger.eller%2Fposts%2F10155818087077655%3A0&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"485\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fthomas.m.ivarsson%2Fposts%2F10156406674553055%3A0&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"354\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\n</slider>"}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":19,"column":1,"offset":1179}}}},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-ast-e586c36bf24a3b7e416fc7a0932fc13c--","value":{"type":"root","children":[],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":83}}}},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-e586c36bf24a3b7e416fc7a0932fc13c--","value":""},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-ast-b54469d040ab5d97ea9c0f303e8abf79--","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Important notes","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":4,"offset":88},"end":{"line":6,"column":19,"offset":103}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":85},"end":{"line":6,"column":19,"offset":103}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"ul","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"All tours start and end in the city of Sibiu;","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":3,"offset":107},"end":{"line":8,"column":48,"offset":152}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":105},"end":{"line":8,"column":48,"offset":152}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"No matter the way chosen to reach Sibiu, the adventurer has to make sure he/she arrives at the starting point of the tour no later than time agreed prior with the tour leader;","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":3,"offset":155},"end":{"line":9,"column":178,"offset":330}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1,"offset":153},"end":{"line":9,"column":178,"offset":330}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Your tour leader will welcome you at the airport and he will be with you all the time along the tour.
