Daily schedule
--------------

### Day 1

**Welcome** to the mysterious Transylvania. Kick off your adventure with your group leader, who is going to wait for you at the starting point of the tour, Cluj Napoca Airport. From there we will head towards the 2007 Capital of Culture, the city of Sibiu. Our first activity will be a **treasure hunt** quest around the old city. The quest has been designed in such way that it will get you through the history of the city and help you discover the story of Sibiu’s 7 towers that influenced the growth of the city. You will have to follow the given clues, and whenever you feel that you are in a struggle, our team will be ready to give you extra hints in order for you to solve the clues and continue your discovery. The day will end with a **gastronomical delight** in terms of traditional food and placement at the Nobleman’s Pantry (Camara Boierului). The restaurant is the embodiment of tradition, culture and folk, starting from the interior designed and all the way to the food served.

### Day 2

The old cities host the culture and traditions of Transylvania, but this is just one side of it. The breath-taking beauty relies in the nature that surrounds the land. That is why on the second day we will embark on an **off-road 4x4 experience**. We will take the snow-covered trails that will lead us to through the forest covered by the beauty of winter, all the way up on the mountains. Along the way, we will stop by different spots with breath-taking views in order for you, the traveller, to enjoy the beauty of the nature and take amazing photos for your portfolio, Instagram, Facebook or simply for the memory of the place. If the weather is not too harsh on us, we will stop for a cosy picnic or a BBQ, consisting of traditional bio products. In order to properly celebrate the adventure, you embarked on, the day will end with a party or a pub crawl.

### Day 3

On the 3rd day we will continue our adventure through the mountains, only this time we will do it **snowshoe hiking** style. Our path will lead us to the Fagaras Mountains, also known as the White Giant of the Carpathians. Here we will visit the ice hotel and church, unique in the South-East Europe. From Balea Lake (2030m), we will start our ascend towards Curmatura Balii (2235m) then we will descend through Valea Doamnei and all they way down to Balea Waterfall (1234m). This is a medium but slightly demanding route that will take 4-5h (including breaks). The altitude level differences will be +200/-1000.  
  
The adventure will end with our return to Cluj-Napoca, where we will enjoy a nice and cosy evening together in the classic Danish “hygge” way.
