  - '"When I travel'
  - >-
    I always pick my destinations from a nature lovers point of view. I like to
    go to remote places
  - >-
    preferably as far away from home as possible and for as long as possible.
    Last summer my brother and I had just a one week window and a very limited
    budged for doing a wilderness hiking trip together in July. We wanted the
    trip to be an adventurous one
  - >-
    and we wanted to go somewhere that was "new ground" for both of us. After a
    bit of research and google image searching
  - we decided on the Carpathian mountains in Romania
  - >-
    which was only a 4 hours flight away from Copenhagen. We knew that the cost
    of living would be very low in Romania (and it certainly was!) Our only
    night in a hotel was 80 DKK each
  - and the hotel was pretty nice! We landed in Sibiu airport
  - >-
    went into town to get supplies for the hiking trip (mainly fuel for the
    stove
  - which was fairly easy to find)
  - >-
    then we got a taxi straight to the very small village og Sebesu de Sus where
    we started our hike right away. The taxi driver was very friendly and was
    eager to hear about our trip. We were lucky that he spoke good spanish which
    is very similar to romanian. Since we both traveled quite some in South
    America
  - >-
    this meant that we could actually speak with this local guy. Talking to
    locals is always great when traveling
  - >-
    so this was an unexpected but very cool surprise. We later discovered that a
    lot of rumanians understand spanish very well. This made communication a lot
    easier for us during the trip
  - >-
    since none of the people we met in the mountains spoke much english. Our
    trail led us through a lush
  - >-
    untouched forest with rich animal and plant life and huge trees towering
    over us as we climbed the steep hills in 30 degrees heat. We were on our way
    to the main ridge of the Fagaras mountain range. From here
  - >-
    we would traverse some 60 km of this impressive and exhaustingly steep
    range. Even with light packs we managed only on average 15 km a day. Only
    when you stand on the top ridge of this mountain range do you realize what
    you have committed to. A lot of scrambling (and sometimes climbing) on very
    exposed granite ridges with huge drops to the green valleys below. From here
  - you can see the vast
  - >-
    flat plateau from which the Carpathians rise so dramatically steep. You have
    the unspoiled view to great valleys filled with old
  - dense forest
  - >-
    dramatic gorges cut into the rock by roaring torrents and even snow caped
    mountains. The trail was easy to find and well marked
  - luckily
  - because we had some days with very foggy weather. In Romania
  - even way above the tree-line
  - >-
    there is a very rich community of flowers and other plants. This makes for
    the most beautiful and contrast-filled scenery. We even got lucky enough to
    see a herd of 15-17 wild black goats one day. We got a very clear
    understanding that this place (although people live up here for sheep
    herding) is a true wilderness
  - >-
    and a big one! We could have easily spend another week or two exploring the
    hidden treasures of these mountains
  - >-
    which seemed to be around every corner. Romania is definitely worthy of more
    trips in the future! I think there are challenges to be found here for even
    the most experienced wilderness-traveler and amazing opportunities for some
    very cool rock climbing as well. The Romanian wilderness will make you feel
    small and insignificant compared nature's forces"

The Romanian wilderness will make you feel small and insignificant compared nature's forces. For me, this is exactly was wilderness travel is about and the Carpathians will leave you with amazing experiences equal to those you get in any of the more "famous" wildernesses around the world. The Carpathians are one of the most adventurous hiking destinations I have found within Europe!
