Me and my boyfriend visited Romania in 2017, as we were backpacking in Eastern Europe. We're used to backpacking and hostel-stays, but we were completely head over heels about the hospital people in Romania, especially in Brasov and Sibiu!

The hostels we stayed at had some great offers , which led us to places like Bran / Bran Castle, a “small” hike to the Brasov sign - where we weirdly enough was caught up in a snowstorm in the middle of April -, a free walking tour in Brasov and much more.

Romania holds a lot of great things like amazing nature, delicious local cuisine and the possibility to explore a place with loads of cultural heritage. We've really had one of the best backpacking-times here, and holds a special place in our hearts too, as we’ve also made some friends for life here. 

Unfortunately, Romania is a bit of an unknown place for many Danes, which is such a shame, as they miss out on great adventures and amazing people! I will definitely visit Romania again and can only recommend others to do the same!
