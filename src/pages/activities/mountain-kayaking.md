# Our natural Water Park

What is better than any day at the office? A rough day on the river or lake! Messy hair, wet feet, blisters on your hands, sparkles in your eyes - that’s what we call KAYAKING experience.

ENHANCE your horizons and get a new PERSPECTIVE of the mountains from its “roots”. We care about your MEMORIES just as much as we care about you having a great time in Transylvania and this is why we count every single detail. Running through Transylvania’s rivers will sure get your arms stronger and your mind more focused onto SLALOMING between the hidden rocks and curves of the rivers.

Take an advantage of this adventure, where the temperamental nature will help to see the mountains from below. Sliding as the water goes and following its natural path will make your trip UNPREDICTABLE and FUN!
