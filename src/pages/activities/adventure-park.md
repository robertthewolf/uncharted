# Always on the edge

Taking a chill relaxing walk through the forest is like taking a sunday walk in the park - too mainstream, too rudimental and for us, too boring. Do not get us wrong, we support every movement, even if it is a park walk. However, if you want to experience something challenging and adventurous, you will find us right here:

The combination of challenging activities and forest walks will get your HEART BEAT FASTER and ADRENALINE PUMP through your veins. If you are tired after all the kilometers walked in the mountains and you just want to enjoy a nice day close to your mountain hut, we made sure not to leave the ADVENTURE aside.

What might seem as just a “childish playground” in the trees, soon you get to realize that it is both a mental and physical challenge. You will be forced to overheat your CREATIVITY engine while hanging in between trees and walking through narrow bridges across the forest.

While being in safe conditions - attached through harness to a metal cable, the fear of height and MOVING OBSTACLES under your feet will give you enough adrenaline to last throughout the whole day. By taking the risk of trying out new things and different levels of performance, you will challenge yourself ESCAPING the COMFORT zone right away… Just saying!
