# Every step is a mystery

We VALUE nature, sustainability and adventures... but more than anything, we value TRUE WILDERNESS. Forget about the traditional concept of hiking and embrace the idea of being amazed with every single step you take within Transylvania’s wild nature. Our paths explore 2 marvellous mountain regions, Fagaras and Cindrel Mountains.

Fagaras Mountains, aka. the Alps of Transylvania, are home to Transylvanian tallest giants, the Moldoveanu (2544 m) and Negoiu (2535m) peaks. As we all know, the giants are really hard to defeat, therefore,  you will be subjected to a mental and physical challenge. Together with Uncharted team you will venture in what will prove to be the GREATEST WILDERNESS EXPERIENCE.

The hidden paths lead through lush, untouched forests with rich wild animal and plant life, with huge trees towering over as you climb the steep rocky mountain ridges in 30 degrees heat or under heavy rain. Great rewards await for those who dare to challenge the 2 giants, Transylvania’s highest peaks, where THE WORLD will be AT YOUR FEET and you will feel INVINCIBLE.

Even though one could claim that Cindrel Mountains lack in height, they compensate in rich culture, nature and traditions unchanged for hundreds of years. If you are looking for a place where the time sits still and people live in harmony within nature - you FOUND IT.

We will pursue hidden paths used by the shepherds that will lead us to their old sheep folds, which are the best 5☆ hotels the mountains can provide. Our challenge will transform you into a DISCOVERER, the one who wants to learn more about the nature surrounding us, the old mountain traditions and the rewards they offer.

SPOILER ALERT !!!! Without revealing all the surprises that await you, we will only say this - “The shepherds know how to cook”.
