# Adventure skiing and Snowboarding

I’m ready for you in every season of the year, just so you know. Skiing/ Snowboarding is one of my winter themed activities and I can guarantee you will have a blast! 

Arena Platos Paltinis was designed in the beginning as an outset for sports and a health complex, which has been primarily oriented towards families. Now, the Ski School is one of the best in Romania, having well-trained staff and motivated participates who later on, will show off their skills. 

Furthermore, the resort has the most modern fun-park in Romania, with nightlights dedicated to three different skiing levels: beginner, intermediate and advanced. 

Lastly, every weekend, Arena Platos Paltinis gathers competitions for professionals, wacky games like “Slide and Freeze” or “Miss Bikini” contests. The audience of these events and the adrenaline that they provide, have made them become legendary within the Carpathian Mountains. 

If a skiing/ snowboarding session is not enough for you, simply just go for the other options too, and remember that you can mix and match your adventure pack, tailoring it for your own personal preferences, abilities and desires!

# Snowshoe Hiking

I am ready for you in every season of the year, just so you know. Snow Shoes Hiking is one of my winter themed activities and I can guarantee you will have a blast!

It is the perfect wither activity for those hiking lovers that wish to be surrounded by snow this time, and create their own trails with a little bit of mystery involved. Snowshoe hiking is the way to go if you find yourself a creative person, ready to discover new paths covered in snow. 

The interesting part of this activity is that there is no learning curve. You know how to walk, therefore you know how to walk in snowshoes too!
