Transylvania Uncharted is the first project of the Uncharted company. Its aim is to create the best mix of mountain activities and old traditions. Each place and activity included in the tours was carefully chosen to provide you with a new experience and an original way to explore and discover the wonders of Transylvania’s history. A history that spreads from the Carpathian Mountains, to Transylvania’s Forests and settles in the old castles and cities, all full of tales ready to be shared. Uncharted puts a lot of emphasis on creating a friendly environment where small groups of 8 to 16 adventurers will embark on a new chapter of their traveling book, through the mesmerizing beauty of Transylvania, a magical place where memories are being formed while footsteps are left behind.
