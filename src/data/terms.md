Travel insurance is compulsory for all our trips. We require that, at a minimum, you are covered for medical expenses including emergency repatriation. We strongly recommend that the policy also covers personal liability, curtailment and loss of luggage and personal effects.  
It is the adventurer’s own responsibility to ensure they purchase a travel insurance. Uncharted IVS is not to be held liable in case of any accidents that could have been covered by the travel insurance.

All Uncharted adventurers need to be in a good physical health in order to fully participate on any of the activities. Please make sure you have read through the itinerary carefully when selecting your adventure and assess your ability to cope with our style of travel.

#### Food and dietary requirements

  

Your tour includes meals as indicated in our brochure and online. Every day breakfast, lunch and dinner will be included. On some of the days, due to certain activities that require longer traveling distances, the lunch will be served either as a lunch-box or in a cosier manner such as a BBQ or a meal made by the shepherds.  
Adventurers with special meal requirements or food allergies **MUST** ensure they or their travel agent has informed Uncharted IVS of this at the time of booking. We can make all the proper adjustments to ensure your dietary requirements are met, as long as we are informed in time.

  

#### Free Courses

  

Some of our activities might seem intimidating for people who never tried them before. Activities such as rock climbing for example. We want to help you overcome your fear and inhibitions and that is why we offer free courses for people who want to try this amazing activity.  
If you consider taking an adventure that has included rock climbing, but you are uncertain about it, write us an email and we will organise for you a free climbing session. There, you have an opportunity to try it out as well as to learn few basic techniques. Afterwards if you decide to buy the package, we throw in 4 more free climbing sessions where you will gain more experience and knowledge about the sport. All sessions will be held with our accredited trainer and instructor. (Note: This applies only for Aarhus commune residents)  
Furthermore, in the winter season, for those of you who want to switch from skis to snowboard or simply want to learn how to slide down the mountain in the cool snowboarding way, we offer free snowboarding training for the period of your tour. You will be thought all the basics and who knows, maybe by the end of the adventure you will already be able to snowboard on your own.

  

#### Pocket Money

  

Romania still employs mostly cash payments; therefore, we recommend you do not fully rely on the possibility of paying with the credit card in all places.  
The currency in Romania is RON (1 RON = 1.62 DKK). Regarding pocket money, you have few options. The first one is to use your credit card and withdraw RON from the local ATM’s. Your tour guide will make sure to find the most suitable one for you with least exchange charges. The second option would be to bring cash (EURO) and change them at the exchange offices.  
Our tours take us through villages and places where the only way to pay for souvenirs is with cash, therefore we strongly advise to have some cash with you at all time.

  

#### Equipment

  

Due to the fact that all tours consist of activities that involve nature and mountains, we strongly recommend that you have on you the following basic equipment at all times:  
  
• Hiking boots  
• Rain jacket  
• Warm clothes, no matter the season.  
  
Specific equipment for the different activities will be provided by Uncharted IVS or the partners. Therefore, all you need to think of is the equipment presented above. If by any chance, extra equipment is necessary, we will inform you, and if you do not have it we will do our best to provide you with the best alternative in order for you to be properly equipped for your adventure.

  

#### Group Leader and travel guides

  

All our adventure tours are accompanied by your group leader from Uncharted team. Your group leader is also your driver and on different activities he will be your instructor as well. The aim of the group leader is to take the hassle out of your travels and to help you have the best trip possible. The group leader will provide information on the places you are travelling through, offer suggestions for things to do and see and organise everything to ensure the best experience for you, the adventurer. He will also introduce you to our local friends along the way. While not being a guide in the traditional sense you can expect him to have a broad general knowledge of the areas visited on the trip, including historical, environmental, cultural and social aspects.  
  
Your group leader was born and raised in the areas where the tours are being held, hence he knows every rock and tree surrounding the city of Sibiu. Moreover, he is a mountain sports enthusiast performing a variety of the mountain activities in the tour, in some of them being also specialised as a professional trainer and instructor:  
  
• Rock Climbing trainer and instructor (activating within Aarhus Klatreklub);  
• Ski and Snowboard instructor.  
  
For other activities, our partners will provide us with the appropriate mountain guides and specific activities travel guides. All of them are experts in their fields, with lots of years of experience on their back. You can find them on our partners’ list.

  

#### Travelling on a group trip

  

As you travel on a group trip you will be exposed to all the pleasures and maybe some of the frustrations of travelling in a group. Your fellow adventurers will probably come from all corners of the world and likely a range of age groups too. We ask you to be understanding of the various needs and preferences of your group - patience with your fellow adventurers is sometimes required for the benefit of everyone's travel experience. Remember too that you have responsibilities to the group. If you are requested to be at a place at a certain time, ensure that you don't keep the rest of the group waiting.  
To ensure a great group environment, we will host an informal meeting, prior to the departure, where you will get the chance to know a bit about the people you will go on the adventure with. Due to privacy reasons however, we are unable to provide you with contact details and any personal information about your fellow adventurers booked on your trip prior to departure.

  

#### Sustainable traveling

  

Uncharted is all about making simple choices to reduce the negative impact on the destinations. Individually, each one of these choices makes only a small difference. But collectively, becoming more conscious about these little things can have a huge impact.  
  
Whether you are passionate about supporting local communities or preserving wildlife and natural resources, there are plenty of ways you can do that. Here is a list of few ways you will make your impact, just by choosing our adventures:  
  
• Our tours consist of a lot of walking in both the nature and urban regions. Often, we may add some biking trails in order to cover more ground, while still remaining conscious about the environment. Therefore, the transportation by car will be reduced to a bare minimum, hence cutting down on gas usage and pollution;  
• Throughout the tour we will always stick to the marked paths, that are there for a reason. And that is to avoid harming native flora;  
• We always keep respectful distance from wildlife. Even though we understand that a selfie with a brown bear or a wild deer could make a great Instagram story, if you are too close to attract the animal’s attention, then you are way too close;  
• Our adventurers are always encouraged and guided towards buying local products rather than those which have been imported. Local artisans, manufacturers and producers are the people we encourage the souvenirs to be brought from. By this we help to preserve the culture, give back to the community and show you, the adventurer, the authenticity of the traditions and the local customs. Think, whether at the end of the day you want to buy an authentic souvenir or one that came straight from the Asian assembly line?  
• All the adventures are held in small groups, up to 16 people. The reason behind is not only to create a cosy environment for the adventurers, but also to lessen the negative impact on the environment. Together we can show that tourism can be done in a responsible, sustainable manner.  
• All elements in every tour are created in such way that in helps to immerse yourself in the local culture. The true definition of a travelling adventure is to get the chance to try different foods, listen to different music and explore different cultures. That is what we do here at Uncharted.
