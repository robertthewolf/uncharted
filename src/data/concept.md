Uncharted was born in Aarhus, Denmark from a young coupleâ€™s idea of **creating a new experience **for adventurers. Transylvania Uncharted is the first project with an aim of creating the best **mix of mountain activities** and **old traditions**. 

Each activity is created after careful researches and a lot of time spent in the mountains; all to ensure the most **authentic spots** and services of Transylvania. Our team is constantly working on **discovering new places** and designing new activities that will take your adventure to the next level.
